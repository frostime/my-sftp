## Tech Stack
- [List primary technologies, e.g. TypeScript, React, Node.js]

## Key Paths
<!-- @RULE: Most important directories/files for quick navigation.
Keep ≤10 entries. Agent uses this to orient in the codebase. -->

| Path | Purpose |
|------|---------|
| `src/` | Source code |
| `tests/` | Test files |

## Conventions
<!-- @RULE: Coding rules that apply across ALL work in this project.
One-liners only. If a convention needs multi-paragraph explanation → write a spec-doc.
Examples: "snake_case for Python, camelCase for JS", "All API routes: /api/v1/*",
"Never commit .env files", "Prefer composition over inheritance" -->

## Notes
<!-- @RULE: Project-level memory. Append-only log of learnings, gotchas, preferences.
Agent appends here during @handover when a discovery is project-wide (not change-specific).
Format each entry as: `- YYYY-MM-DD: <learning>`
Prune entries that become outdated or graduate to Conventions/spec-docs. -->
